# Rubish

A "ruby interpreter" guaranteed that will always give you the wrong result

## Description
This is the result of this reddit post https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/50lof9/revised_argument_for_why_it_is_not_possible_for/ and 15 minutes of boredom, "What if there were an interpreter that will always give you a wrong result?"

To run
  ````
    $./rubi.sh your_ruby_script.rb
  ```

# But wait!, There is a catch!
This is NOT a real ruby interpreter its just a really short bash script YOU STILL NEED TO HAVE RUBY INSTALLED IN YOUR MACHINE TO RUN IT!

## FAQ
Why Ruby?
- Because its my favourite language, and it makes an excellent pun "ruby" "rubbish", "ish" (denotes a pejorative term), get it?

Why Bash?
- Beacuse it was the fastest way I thought to get the result I wanted without actually having to write a real interpreter.

But, Why... uhm... eh... 
- If you haven't noticed yet this is just a joke.


## UNEXPECTED Challenge!
Write a Ruby Script that actually print the correct result!

Rule:
- You can't modify the rubi.sh file in any way, good luck!
